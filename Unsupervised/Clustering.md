# Clustering

**Cluster analysis or clustering** is a foundational technique in exploratory data analysis. At its core, it partitions a set of objects into groups such that objects within the same group (a *cluster*) are **more similar to one another** (in some analytically defined sense) than to objects in other groups.

This approach sits at the heart of statistical data analysis and appears across a wide range of disciplines, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics, and machine learning.

Here is an editorial breakdown of clustering models. Understanding that "clustering" is not a single specific algorithm, but rather a broad task to be solved, is key to data science. The choice of model dictates the shape of the clusters found.

## Clustering Models

In unsupervised machine learning, clustering is the art of finding structure in chaos. However, "structure" is subjective. A dataset that looks like a singular blob to one algorithm might look like three distinct rings to another. To choose the right tool, we must understand the mathematical philosophy behind each model family.

### 1. Connectivity Models (Hierarchical Clustering)

These models are built on the intuition that data points closer in data space are more related to each other than to data points farther away. They don't just find a single partition; they find a hierarchy of relations.

* **How it works:** The algorithm connects "neighbors" to form small clusters, then connects those clusters to form larger ones. This can be visualized as a **Dendrogram** (a tree diagram).
* **The "Better" Explanation:** Think of this like an evolutionary tree. You don't just know that a cat and a dog are animals; you can see exactly where their branches diverged. You can cut the tree at different heights to get specific numbers of clusters.
* **Key Algorithms:** Agglomerative Clustering, DIVISIVE.

### 2. Centroid Models (K-Means)

This is the most common form of clustering, representing a cluster by a central vector (the mean).

* **How it works:** You define $k$ (the number of clusters). The algorithm places $k$ points (centroids) in the data and iteratively moves them until they sit at the center of a group of data points.
* **The "Better" Explanation:** This model assumes clusters are distinct, non-overlapping spheres. It is essentially an optimization problem to minimize the distance between points and their assigned cluster center. However, because it forces spherical shapes, it often fails when data is shaped like crescents or rings.
* **Key Algorithms:** K-Means, K-Medoids.

### 3. Distribution Models

While Centroid models force a hard choice (Point A is in Cluster 1), Distribution models embrace uncertainty. They assume data is generated by statistical distributions.

* **How it works:** These algorithms attempt to fit distribution curves (usually Gaussian/Normal) to the data.
* **The "Better" Explanation:** This is "Soft Clustering." Instead of saying a customer belongs 100% to the "High Spender" cluster, the model might say there is a 70% probability they are a "High Spender" and a 30% probability they are a "Casual Shopper." It captures correlation and dependence between attributes better than K-Means.
* **Key Algorithms:** Expectation-Maximization (EM), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

### 4. Density Models

These models solve a major flaw in Centroid models: the inability to handle irregular shapes and noise.

* **How it works:** They define clusters as areas of high point density separated by areas of low point density.
* **The "Better" Explanation:** Imagine looking at a satellite map of an archipelago. The islands (clusters) can be any shape—long, curved, or round—because they are defined by where the land (data) is thickest. Points floating alone in the ocean are correctly identified as noise or outliers, rather than being forced into a cluster.
* **Key Algorithms:** DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), OPTICS.

### 5. Subspace Models

In high-dimensional data (like genomics with thousands of genes), data points might only cluster closely in a *subset* of dimensions.

* **How it works:** These algorithms search for clusters in specific projections of the data, rather than using every single attribute simultaneously.
* **The "Better" Explanation:** In a dataset of patients, "Cluster A" might be similar based only on blood pressure and age, while "Cluster B" matches based on height and weight. Subspace clustering (or **Biclustering**) finds these local patterns where row and column correlations exist simultaneously.
* **Key Algorithms:** CLIQUE, Biclustering algorithms.

### 6. Group Models

These are less about iterative machine learning and more about logical grouping based on existing data structures.

* **The "Better" Explanation:** These techniques often rely on manual constraints or "least common denominator" logic. They provide grouping information based on exact matches or simple logical rules rather than optimizing a mathematical cost function (like distance or density).

### 7. Graph-Based Models

These models view data points as nodes in a network and similarity as edges connecting them.

* **How it works:** A cluster is defined as a connected subgraph, such as a **Clique** (where every node is connected to every other node).
* **The "Better" Explanation:** This is highly effective for social network analysis or protein interaction networks. Algorithms look for "communities" where connections are dense internally but sparse externally. Relaxed versions, like *quasi-cliques*, allow for real-world messiness where a few connections might be missing.
* **Key Algorithms:** HCS (Highly Connected Subgraphs), Spectral Clustering.

### 8. Signed Graph Models

This extends graph clustering by adding "sentiment" to the connections: Positive (+) edges (friendship/similarity) and Negative (-) edges (animosity/dissimilarity).

* **How it works:** It relies on **Balance Theory** (social psychology). A balanced cycle typically follows the rule: "The friend of my friend is my friend" and "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
* **The "Better" Explanation:** The goal is to partition the graph so that most edges *within* a cluster are positive, and edges *between* clusters are negative. If the "clusterability axiom" holds, the network naturally fractures into opposing coalitions (polarized groups).

### 9. Neural Models

These use neural network architectures to learn the topology of the input data.

* **How it works:** Neurons compete to represent different parts of the input space.
* **The "Better" Explanation:** The most famous is the **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**. Imagine a flexible net thrown over the data cloud. The net stretches and warps so that its nodes align with the data. It preserves topology: points that are close in the high-dimensional input space get mapped to nearby nodes on the 2D neural map. It is a powerful tool for visualizing high-dimensional clusters.
